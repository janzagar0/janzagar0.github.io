                    My masters capstone project arose from my job as a GIS graduate assistant at McKeldin Library. I
                    wanted to replicate the 3D workflow
                    established by ASU's groundbreaking <a href="https://mapgeoasu.github.io/3dexplorer/"
                        target="_blank">3D Explorer</a> web application. It features a
                    3D model, replicated through hours of field measurements, of the McKeldin Library's map collection,
                    which is housed in 50 different
                    cabinets and bookcases. It is uncatalogued, so to promote user discovery and exploration, a query
                    system was devised based on known
                    information about the contents of individual drawers or nooks. Users can search by map category
                    (topographic, aeronautical, atlas, etc.),
                    container ID number, or geographic location. Development of the application was done with HTML, CSS,
                    JavaScript, and the ArcGIS Maps
                    SDK for JavaScript.

                    This is an Experience Builder-powered web application that showcases University of Maryland McKeldin
                    Library's database of United States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) plant patents. Users can
                    filter the data by plant category or inventor country or US state. The dataset consists of over
                    40,000
                    entries (one per inventor, as some patents have more than one inventor) that were cleaned up by the
                    staff
                    of the GIS and Data Service Center. More information about this project can be found by clicking the
                    "About this Project" link in the web application.

                    This is a small, simple web app that I created while working under Dr. Kathleen Stewart for the
                    purposes of
                    visualizing selected Barbershops and Cosmetologists in the greater Houston area. This app with
                    created with
                    Kepler.gl, which allows for the creation of simple, front-end only web apps, and was used as a
                    visual aid by
                    researchers at the UMD School of Public Health.

                <text class="body-text">
                    I have worked extensively on UMD's ArcGIS Indoors implementation project, creating level-aware maps
                    of various
                    buildings on campus, testing and doing quality control on IPS deployments, and created mobile apps
                    to help guide
                    users to assets within buildings. I have also created realistic 3D models of buildings, both
                    exterior and interior
                    (including assets such as cabinets, offices, etc.) using ArcGIS Pro. These indoor models have then
                    been deployed
                    by my coworkers and I into fully-functional mobile apps for testing.

                <text class="body-text">
                    This custom tool was created to automate the process of creating Network Spatial Weights Matrices
                    (NSWM) for enhancing
                    network-based analysis of car crashes in Prince George's County, MD. It takes multiple inputs,
                    including a network
                    dataset template, to produce a .swm (spatial weights matrix) file that weighs the severity of car
                    crashes (property damage,
                    injury, fatal). This file can then be used in several spatial statistics tools, including Local
                    Moran's I and Getis-Ord Gi*
                    hot spot analysis (as shown above on right), to analyze where the most serious crashes in the county
                    tend to be clustered.
