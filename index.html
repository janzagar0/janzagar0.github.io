        <p>My name is Jose Anza Garcia and I am about to wrap up my Masters in GIS at the University of
            Maryland. I hope you enjoy this sample of my work, and feel free to contact me if you have
            any questions or suggestions!

                    <p>This is an Experience Builder-powered web application that showcases University of Maryland McKeldin 
                        Library's database of United States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) plant patents. Users can 
                        filter the data by plant category or inventor country or US state. The dataset consists of over 40,000 
                        entries (one per inventor, as some patents have more than one inventor) that were cleaned up by the staff
                         of the GIS and Data Service Center. More information about this project can be found by clicking the
                        "About this Project" link in the web application.

                        am working on getting it fixed soon, so view preferably on a larger screen.

                            in the greater Houston area. This app with created with Kepler.gl, which allows for the creation of simple, front-end only web apps, and was used as a visual aid
                            by researchers at the UMD School of Public Health.

                <div class="card-body">
                    <p>I have worked extensively on UMD's ArcGIS Indoors implementation project, creating level-aware maps of various
                        buildings on campus, testing and doing quality control on IPS deployments, and created mobile apps to help
                        guide users to assets within buildings. I have also created realistic 3D models of buildings, both exterior
                        and interior (including assets such as cabinets, offices, etc.) using ArcGIS Pro. These indoor models have then
                        been deployed by my coworkers and I into fully-functional mobile apps for testing.

                    <p>This custom tool was created to automate the process of creating Network Spatial Weights Matrices (NSWM) for 
                        enhancing network-based analysis of car crashes in Prince George's County, MD. It takes multiple inputs,
                        including a network dataset template, to produce a .swm (spatial weights matrix) file that weighs the severity
                        of car crashes (property damage, injury, fatal). This file can then be used in several spatial statistics tools, 
                        including Local Moran's I and Getis-Ord Gi* hot spot analysis (as shown above on right), to analyze where the most 
                        serious crashes in the county tend to be clustered.
